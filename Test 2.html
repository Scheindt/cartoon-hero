<h1>I love freedom</h1>
<p>Howdy. I just found out that people that I love can sometimes do bad stuff and they don't even know. The fun fact about it is that yuo have to choose tp be a better man and accept the fact that even your loved ones can be damaging. I do believe that the best thing you can do in this situation is hope that other people do not make the bad choices that your loved ones do. It's a helluva thing isn't it? Having to place your trust into strangers rather than your closest mentor. Life can be surprising.... and depressing.</p>
