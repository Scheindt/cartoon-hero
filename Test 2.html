	<h1>Hope and Freedom</h1>
	<p>The fun fact about the world is that you can to choose to be a better person and accept the fact that even your loved ones can be wrong. I do believe that the best thing you can do in this situation is <b>Hope</b> that other people do not make the bad choices that our loved ones can, at times, do. We need to forgive and forget since this is what the world should be. That is <b>Love</b>. <br>
	It is not about bad will don't get me wrong. Our big power is <b>Hope</b>.To give a prime example of this I would like to give good nod to the good people of the world that want nothing but freedom. <br> </p>

	<p> At times, we would like to convince all people of our beliefs and strong convictions but that would. 
	You know why things can go in a good way? Here is why: <br>
	love and respect. <br>
	This is not a political webpage. Just a random Lorem Ipsum of both good and bad thoughts. Thanks for reading :)</p>
